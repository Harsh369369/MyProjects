# Tax Calculation App README

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Tax Calculation App and its features.

## Features

### Tax Calculation Formula

- The tax calculation works based on the following formula:
    - Overall income (after deductions) under 8 (≤) Lakhs is not taxed.
    - Income over 8 (>) Lakhs is taxed at different rates based on age.
        - 30% for people with age < 40
        - 40% for people with age ≥ 40 but < 60
        - 10% for people with age ≥ 60

### Error Handling

- Users are not restricted from entering incorrect values like characters in the number fields.
    - Errors are highlighted with an error icon to the right of the input field.
    - Hovering over the error icon shows the error in a tooltip.
    - Error icons are not visible in the form by default.

### Age Dropdown Field

- The age dropdown field has 3 values:
    - <40
    - ≥ 40 & < 60
    - ≥ 60
- If the user has not entered this value and clicks on submit, an error icon is shown indicating that the input field is mandatory.

### Submit Action

- Clicking on submit shows a modal displaying the final values based on the calculations.
